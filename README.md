This program works like a small shopping cart for an online store.
You enter how many products you want to buy.
For each product, you give its name, price, and quantity.
At the end, you choose a discount type:
Festive → 10% off the total bill
Bulk → 20% off if you buy more than 5 of the same item
The program then:

Stores all products in a list
Calculates the total cost
Applies the discount
Shows each product’s details and the final amount you have to pay
